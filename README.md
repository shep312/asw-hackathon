# ASW Hackathon

## Local store price optimisation

This repo contains a web portal allowing ASW colleagues to visualise and confirm price changes suggested by our model, as well as a notebook illustrating the performace of the model.

The model is a LightGBM algo that can understand ASW's pricing strategy well enough to predict it accurately. Our concept is then that through a series of sale price experiments (real-life gradient descent), we can understand our product's price elasticity by a number of feautres (location, weather, competitor data) to optimise prices for profit.

## ASW customer impact

Optimising prices for profit may seem un-beneficial to customers. However, we believe that it can bring benefit through a couple of methods:

 - Some prices, for example on very slow sellers, will be reduced limitig the overall basked impact
 - Optimising for profit may significantly increase the business' margin. This could then be reinvested into price while maintaining competitiveness to improve our customer offer overall
